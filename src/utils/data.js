      movie_review: `happy feet is a movie that talks about a special emperor penguin, brave and different from all other penguins, this penguin could not sing like other penguins do; His natural talent was dancing and for this reason they did not accept him and discriminated against him, which prevents him from declaring his love to glory.
      mumble He suffered a lot, only his parents believed that his talent was incredible, they supported him and encouraged him to keep going.
      In my personal opinion, I loved the movie because it teaches us that we should appreciate others no matter how different they seem to us and see their special and particular gifts more deeply.
      In addition to the fact that the movie is very cute, its characters are beautiful.`

      movie_review: `John Dolittle, a famous veterinarian who has the ability to communicate with animals and goes on an adventure to find a cure for Queen Victoria's disease, despite being a good movie with an interesting plot, he feels that his protagonist, Robert Downey Jr. is not used to the maximum as an actor and the story in general has many plot holes, it is a pretty funny movie.
      In summary, although ''Doctor Dolittle'' has some positive points, overall, it is a disappointing film that fails to realize its potential.`

      movie_review: "A film that left its mark, never better said, both in terms of merchandising, sequels, videogames, etc. A whole display of special effects that were truly a challenge for the time and that marked a line to follow in the recreation of animals and other beings. computer generated. The integration with the real world is quite good and there are practically no bugs. The interpretations, especially that of the children, are excellent, adding tension at the right moments. Adults also have good reactions and do quite well. Guaranteed entertainment throughout the journey"
